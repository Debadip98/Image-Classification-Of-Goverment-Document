# Image-Classification-Of-Goverment-Document
#I have a data set that contains six image zip files. Each zip file contains 100 images of various government documents.


##Methodology: extract data from ZIP, split data, train-test-validation, Build a CNN model. Use data augmentation to get the best accuracy. Use the early stop function to reduce high computation power. Learning rate schedule, Set the hyperparameter and fit the model.


##Evaluate the matrix-accuracy score,F1 score, precision, recall,MCC, AUC, and CM.

##Visualisation: Accuracy vs. Epoch, Loss vs. Epoch, Confusion Matrix
